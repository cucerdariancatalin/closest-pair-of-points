# Closest Pair of Points

This repository contains an implementation of the Closest Pair of Points algorithm in Kotlin, a modern and concise programming language. The algorithm finds the two points in a set of points with the smallest distance between them.

The implementation uses the Divide and Conquer method to efficiently solve the problem. The input points are sorted by their x-coordinate, and then the closest pair of points are found in the left and right halves of the sorted points. The closest pair of points in a strip of points within a certain distance from the dividing line is also found. The minimum of the closest pair of points found in the left and right halves and the closest pair of points in the strip is returned as the solution.

This code is open-source and contributions are welcome to improve its functionality and performance.
